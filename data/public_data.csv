But the character in Novel A made no sense. I know it was just a segment of the novel without a lot of context, but I couldn't make sense of their motivations. They were annoyed at how they chose to wake up. They were annoyed that they got a black car and lived in the desert now. They were annoyed that they took the day off work and went to hike and found out that the hike they chose was 6 miles long? I was so confused at that. Like first, you can always turn around, it's not a mandatory 6 miles. Also, YOU CHOSE THIS. You called off work for it! It didn't make sense.
I even copied a line that I especially hated: ""Sam took frequent water breaks, which wasn't too embarrassing, since she saw only one other hiker on the trail"" - uh, what?

Here are a few motivations an artist might find in Novel B:
Novel B portrays how inspiration can strike unexpectedly in the most mundane of settings, such as a snowy morning at a cafe. As an artist, you might resonate with the idea of finding beauty and inspiration in everyday scenes and objects, and Novel B captures this sentiment beautifully.
Novel B delves into the artistic process, showcasing how Alex meticulously sketches his surroundings and adds vibrant colors to bring his artwork to life. As an artist, you might appreciate the attention to detail and the exploration of different artistic techniques depicted in the novel.
Novel B explores the universal theme of self-doubt and the fear of failure that many artists experience. Alex's hesitation to submit his work to an art gallery reflects the internal struggles and insecurities that artists often face. However, his determination to overcome these obstacles and pursue his passion despite his fears can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for fellow artists.
Through Alex's journey, Novel B highlights the importance of connection and support within the creative community. As an artist, you might appreciate the camaraderie and encouragement shared among artists, as well as the opportunity for growth and collaboration that comes from being part of a creative community.

Overall, Novel B offers a relatable and inspiring portrayal of the artistic journey, making it a motivating read for artists seeking encouragement, validation, and a deeper understanding of their craft.

I like art and the parts about her drawing on her sketch pad and adding the color to the page sounded reasonable and had me wondering what it looked like.  Also, at the end when she was going to enter the contest because now the had confidence to do that. Exciting and something I could relate with.

In contrast, the first novel's unpredictable nature rendered it less engaging and its composition felt inferior. The second story's eloquence enthralled me, making me keen to uncover the protagonist's next steps—I was curious about the unfolding of her day. Conversely, the first novel's ambiguous trajectory left me indifferent to its conclusion; the protagonist failed to capture my interest, and I felt no inclination to follow his further actions.",25-35,Woman,,"$100,000-$199,999",United States of America,Yes,22041,Very liberal,,,,,,M,Hike,1,Other,0,1

It gave me a much clearer picture of what was going on and seemed like it was leading to a natural conclusion just based on the one page that I read.
